TO DO:
Is precession frequency correct for axy-symmetric rotor?
Render lines which represent omega and L.
Allow user to adjust L?
Implement a lagrangian and/or hamiltonian version of this?
Implement a version which'll allow setting of initial omegas?
Insert slider for controlling time-step (and anything else, such as [Lx, Ly, Lz]?).
Tabulate things better.
Consider doing this with quaternions.
Insert meta-tags.
Put this in physics-sims project?
Incorporate this technology into "Asteroid Field" sim?
