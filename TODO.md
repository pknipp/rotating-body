git push heroku master

TO DO:
render inputs in following order:
    L ( = [0, 0, Lz])
    moments of inertia (preceded by a dropdown w/"isotropic", "axisymmetric", and "asymmetric")
    Euler angles (precedece by dropdown for (along symmetry axis, near one of the principal axes)
Render lines which represent (fixed-frame) omega and principal axes.
Allow user to adjust L?
Implement a lagrangian and/or hamiltonian version of this?
Implement a version which'll allow setting of initial omegas?
Insert slider for controlling time-step (and anything else, such as [Lx, Ly, Lz]?).
Tabulate things better.
Consider doing this with quaternions.
Insert meta-tags.
Put this in physics-sims project?
Incorporate this technology into "Asteroid Field" sim?
Introduce perspective
Make faces somewhat transparent.
Insert edges (solid or dashed, depending upon their visibility)
