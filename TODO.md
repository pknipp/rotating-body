git push heroku master

TO DO:
DEF:
Put padding to right of buttons (and elsewhere?).
Have y&z point up and out, respectively.
Insert meta-tags.
Adjust colors, transparency, edges (solid or dashed)
Change euler-angle inputs from text to number, to allow roller.
Figure out what - if anything - gets broken if a moment equals zero
What is best way to provide more info in re shape types dropdown: toggled info box, or "title" for each option?
Make length of omfs less than those of axes, so that they both appear for axisymmetric case.
(Eventually) adjust defaults to asymmetric rotor rotating about intermediate axis.

MAYBE:
Implement a lagrangian and/or hamiltonian version of this?
Implement a version which'll allow setting of initial omegas?
Consider doing this with quaternions.
Implement A/B switches for choices of y-direction and z-direction?
Implement A/B switch for toggling between body frame and lab frame?
Put this in physics-sims project?
Incorporate this technology into "Asteroid Field" sim?
Figure out a logical way to display omega in body frame?
Figure out what - if anything - gets broken if I1 = I2 + i3.
