git push heroku master

TO DO:
DEF:
Put padding to right of buttons (and elsewhere?).
Have y&z point up and out, respectively.
Insert meta-tags.
Adjust colors, transparency, edges (solid or dashed)
Figure out what - if anything - gets broken if a moment equals zero
Use "titles" for each of the dropdown options for body shape
Make length of omfs less than those of axes, so that they both appear for axisymmetric case.

MAYBE:
Implement a lagrangian and/or hamiltonian version of this?
Implement a version which'll allow setting of initial omegas?
Consider doing this with quaternions.
Implement A/B switches for choices of y-direction and z-direction?
Implement A/B switch for toggling between body frame and lab frame?
Put this in physics-sims project?
Incorporate this technology into "Asteroid Field" sim?
Figure out a logical way to display omega in body frame?
Figure out what - if anything - gets broken if I1 = I2 + i3.
